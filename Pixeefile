Subject: Confirmation of Ownership â€“ Docker Image Hardening Process

Hi [DevOps Leadâ€™s Name],

We are in the process of formalising the Docker Image Hardening procedure to ensure all application images follow secure and standardised permission settings.

As part of this process:

The Engineering team will raise a request to the AppSec team for hardening review.

The AppSec team will define the required file and folder permissions (read, write, execute) based on the applicationâ€™s functionality and will share the details in a permissions text file.

The DevOps team will create the Docker image as per these security configurations and push it to the Harbor repository.

The AppSec team will verify that the permissions have been correctly implemented, followed by QA validation to ensure functionality is not impacted.


Request you to please confirm who from the DevOps team will own this process and act as the single point of contact for coordination with AppSec and QA.

Below is a summary of roles and responsibilities for reference:
