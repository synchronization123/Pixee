1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to embed essential security parameters into Chata.ai so that during design specification reviews, the system can proactively provide security-focused suggestions to architects, developers, and reviewers. This will help in identifying risks early and ensuring security by design.


---

2. Objectives

Define a set of essential security parameters aligned with organizational standards and best practices (OWASP, NIST, ISO27001).

Integrate these parameters into Chata.ai’s knowledge base and suggestion engine.

Enable Chata.ai to provide context-aware security recommendations during design specification reviews.

Validate the accuracy and relevance of generated suggestions through stakeholder reviews.

Deliver documentation and training for effective adoption.



---

3. Scope of Work

In-Scope

Identification and finalization of essential security parameters.

Integration of parameters into Chata.ai for design review workflows.

Development of AI-driven recommendation logic for design reviews.

Testing and validation of suggestions with selected use cases.

Documentation and knowledge-sharing sessions for end-users.


Out-of-Scope

Full redesign of Chata.ai’s core architecture.

Automated code scanning or penetration testing.

Integration with external systems outside design review scope.



---

4. Deliverables

Finalized list of essential security parameters.

Enhanced Chata.ai system with integrated security suggestion capability.

Test cases and validation results from pilot reviews.

Documentation and training material for stakeholders.

Final project report and stakeholder presentation.



---

5. Assumptions

Security standards and organizational policies are available for alignment.

Chata.ai’s existing architecture supports parameter integration.

Stakeholders will provide timely feedback during pilot reviews.



---

6. Constraints

Limited to design specification review workflows within Chata.ai.

Project completion depends on availability of subject matter experts.

Budget and resources are fixed for the current phase.
