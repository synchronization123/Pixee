1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a standardized Security Questionnaire that will be used to evaluate the security aspects of all design specifications within the organization. This will ensure that potential risks are identified early, and security best practices are embedded into the design lifecycle.


---

2. Objectives

Establish a consistent process for assessing design specifications from a security perspective.

Identify potential vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, or risks at the design stage.

Align the questionnaire with OWASP, NIST, and internal security policies.

Provide stakeholders with a structured method to review and approve secure design specifications.



---

3. Scope of Work

In-Scope

Development of a Security Questionnaire covering key domains (Authentication, Authorization, Data Security, Privacy, Logging, Threat Modeling, etc.).

Mapping questionnaire items to relevant security standards and compliance requirements.

Integration of questionnaire into design review workflows.

Conducting a pilot phase with selected projects.

Documentation and training for teams on usage.


Out-of-Scope

Automated penetration testing or code review.

Implementation of remediation activities identified through the questionnaire.

Full audit or certification activities.



---

4. Deliverables

Finalized Design Specifications Security Questionnaire (digital format).

Mapping matrix to standards (OWASP, NIST, ISO27001).

Training material for engineering and product teams.

Documentation outlining process integration.

Pilot results and recommendations.



---

5. Assumptions

Security policies and standards are available for alignment.

Stakeholders (Architects, Security, Product Owners) will participate in reviews.

Questionnaire will be maintained as a living document with periodic updates.



---

6. Constraints

Must be completed within 8 weeks.

Limited to web and enterprise applications in the first phase.

Should align with existing governance tools (e.g., Confluence/Jira).
