Title:
Unauthenticated URL Generation in SmallURL Service

Description:
The SmallURL application currently allows anyone to generate shortened links without requiring authentication. For example:

https://smallurl.crm.com/newurl=https://google.com

This request succeeds even when the user is not logged in, resulting in a valid shortened URL.

Security impact:

Attackers can mass-generate malicious short links using the companyâ€™s domain.

Increases risk of phishing, spam, and reputation damage.

No accountability since link creation is not tied to an authenticated user.


Recommendation:

Enforce authentication before allowing URL creation.

Implement rate limiting to prevent automated abuse.

Log creator details (user ID, IP) for audit and monitoring.
