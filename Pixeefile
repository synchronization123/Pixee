Jira Title:
Unauthorized access to surveys created by other practices

Jira Description:
A user is able to view surveys that were created by other practices, which they should not have access to. Additionally, the user can see the survey creator details, exposing sensitive information.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Log in as a regular user belonging to Practice A.


2. Navigate to the Surveys section.


3. Observe that surveys created under Practice B are visible.


4. Notice that the creator details (who created the survey) are also exposed.



Impact:

Breach of data isolation between practices.

Disclosure of survey creator identity and associated metadata.

Potential privacy and compliance risks.


Expected Behavior:

A user should only be able to view surveys belonging to their own practice.

Creator details should only be visible within the same practice.


Severity (as per CVSS v4.0 Calculator):

Base Score: 6.3 (Medium)

Vector: AV:N / AC:L / AT:N / PR:L / UI:N / VC:L / VI:L / VA:N / SC:L / SI:N / SA:N


Rationale:

Exploitable over the network without user interaction.

Low privileges required (any logged-in user).

Limited but notable confidentiality impact (viewing surveys and creator details).

Low to no availability impact
