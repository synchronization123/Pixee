Jira Title:
CDNmn Portal Accessible After CRM Logout (Authentication Not Enforced)

ðŸ”¹ Description:
The CDNmn portal remains accessible even after the user logs out of the CRM.

Expected behavior: Logging out of the CRM should terminate the session and revoke access to all integrated portals, including CDNmn.

Actual behavior: The CDNmn portal can still be accessed post-logout, indicating that session authentication and invalidation are not being enforced properly.

This exposes authenticated resources to unauthorized access and poses a security risk.


ðŸ”¹ Impact (CVSS 4.0 â€“ Medium Severity):

Users retain unintended access to CDNmn after CRM logout.

Increases risk of session hijacking, data leakage, and misuse of portal resources.

Violates secure session management principles (e.g., OWASP A07:2021 â€“ Identification and Authentication Failures).


ðŸ”¹ Remediation:

1. Enforce session validation for CDNmn portal requests.


2. Ensure logout from CRM propagates to all integrated services, invalidating associated tokens/sessions.


3. Implement centralized session management to prevent reuse of stale sessions.


4. Conduct regular testing of authentication flows to confirm that session termination works as intended.
