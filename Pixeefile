Title:
Open Redirect Vulnerability in SmallURL Service Allows Phishing via Company Domain

Description:
The internal URL-shortening service SmallURL currently allows creation of short links for arbitrary external destinations without validation.

For example:

https://smallurl.crm.com/newurl=https://google.com

produces:

https://smallurl.crm.com/48483838r83838383

This behavior enables attackers to generate malicious links under the trusted crm.com domain and redirect victims to phishing or malware sites. Since the links use the company’s official domain, users may implicitly trust them, increasing the success rate of phishing campaigns.

Security impact:

Phishing attacks can be carried out using the company’s domain.

Brand/reputation damage if the domain is flagged for malicious use.

Credential theft and fraud if employees or customers are misled into providing sensitive data.

Recommendation:

Enforce URL validation and restrict shortening to trusted/allowed domains.

Block dangerous schemes (javascript:, data:, etc.).

Require authentication or rate limiting for link creation.

Provide interstitial warnings when redirecting to external sites.

Monitor logs for abuse and implement a takedown process.
