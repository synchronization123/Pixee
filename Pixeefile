1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to strengthen the security posture of Python-based applications and services. This includes hardening frameworks (FastAPI, Unicorn, Hypercorn), performing code reviews, and ensuring best practices are consistently applied.


---

2. Objectives

Complete hardening activities for FastAPI framework.

Conduct research and analysis for Unicorn and Hypercorn frameworks.

Perform Python code reviews to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

Share findings and recommendations with the development and security teams.



---

3. Scope of Work

In-Scope

Hardening of FastAPI framework (completed).

Research and analysis for Unicorn and Hypercorn frameworks.

Comprehensive Python code review (completed).

Sharing finalized review reports with the team.

Recommendations for secure configurations, patching, and coding standards.


Out-of-Scope

Development of new features in frameworks.

Long-term monitoring of all services (to be handled under ongoing security operations).

Vendor-driven changes or patches outside organizational control.

4. Deliverables

Hardened FastAPI framework documentation and configurations.

Research & analysis report for Unicorn and Hypercorn.

Completed Python code review report.

Team knowledge-sharing session with findings and recommendations.



---

5. Assumptions

Security guidelines and industry best practices (e.g., OWASP, CIS Benchmarks) are available.

Development teams are available for review and knowledge-sharing sessions.

All activities are aligned with organizational security policies.



---

6. Constraints

Project deadlines are fixed for each framework phase.

Limited to frameworks in use (FastAPI, Unicorn, Hypercorn).

Availability of experts for framework-specific analysis may impact schedule.
