2. Objectives

Conduct production-level verification and audit of all applications listed under the Approved Listing Framework.

Validate compliance with required security parameters such as block mode enforcement and central defense configurations.

Identify and revalidate applications that could not be verified initially.

Provide remediation recommendations for failed or non-compliant applications.

Deliver a consolidated audit summary report for management review.

3. Scope of Work

In-Scope

Audit of 88 applications as provided by Dan.

Verification of production configurations against approved framework controls.

Revalidation of applications where verification was not completed due to access or environment limitations.

Tracking and reporting of application audit results.


Out-of-Scope

Implementation of remediations or patch deployments.

Audits of non-production or decommissioned applications.

Architectural redesigns or major configuration changes.

4. Deliverables

Completed audit reports for all 88 applications.

Revalidation reports for 6 applications requiring additional review.

Consolidated compliance summary including block mode, central defense, and failure analysis.

Final summary report with recommendations and closure status.

5. Assumptions

Application owners will provide timely access to production environments.

Necessary audit tools and scripts are available and approved for production use.

The data provided by Dan is accurate and complete.
